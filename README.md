## 1)Purpose
The purpose of this research is to understand how fintech is affecting the public discourse about banking. We argue that the banking market is going through transformation and according to Fligstein (1996) “during periods of market transformation, invaders can reintroduce more fluid social movement-like conditions.” Our research will focus on discovering what new dominating discourse the fintech movement is bringing about through social movements. By using the Twitter social media platform, we aim to explain how the public discourse is being changed. We are going to use several natural language processing methods (all code is provided in this repository) to process the tweets and answer the following research question:

**How fintech has affected the public discourse about banking?**
